Bike Sales Dashboard in MS Excel

I created this dashboard by using a variety of data visualization techniques to provide insights into bike sales by marital status, region, and education status.

The dashboard is prepared in a way easy to read and understand, with clear labels and descriptions for all of the visualizations. It is also an interactive dashboard that includes slicers, which allow users to interact with the data and filter the visualizations as per their needs. It allows users to see the insights in different ways and identify trends that they might not have noticed otherwise.

This information can be used by bike retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to make better decisions about future marketing strategies and grow their businesses.
